## About Me
I'm a dedicated Data Engineer with a passion for designing, implementing, and maintaining data pipelines and ETL processes. With three years of experience in the field, I have honed my skills in various technologies and methodologies to enhance data-driven decision-making processes.

## Professional Experience
- **Company:** Tata Consultancy Services, Chennai, India
- **Position:** Systems Engineer
- **Duration:** July 2019 â€“ July 2022

During my tenure at Tata Consultancy Services, I had the privilege of leading a high-performing Agile team, specializing in ETL processes. My expertise extends to utilizing tools such as Informatica PowerCenter, IBM Sterling, Oracle SQL Developer, and BMC Control-M Scheduler. I've designed, developed, and implemented intricate code solutions for seamless file transfers across diverse sources, ensuring data flows seamlessly to HIVE tables and other target systems. My innovative approach to automation streamlined 30% of manual work associated with regular file transfer requests.

## Projects
- **Vehicle Price Prediction:** Leveraging machine learning models, I achieved a remarkable 98% accuracy in predicting car resale prices. I employed Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Fully Connected Neural Networks to accomplish this.

- **Crime Data Analysis of Baltimore City using AWS:** Utilizing AWS S3 and Athena, I loaded, cleaned, and performed ETL on crime records in Baltimore. I then employed Tableau for visualization to identify patterns in crime data, such as the month, location, time, and types of crimes.

- **Crime Data Analysis of Los Angeles using PySpark:** I employed PySpark to load, clean, and perform initial analysis of crime data in Los Angeles. Subsequently, I used Tableau for visualization to uncover patterns in crime data, particularly focusing on why crime is concentrated in specific areas.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, NoSQL, JavaScript, C/C++
- **Applications/Tools:** Informatica PowerCenter, Oracle SQL Developer, AWS (S3, Athena, EC2, Dynamo DB), BMC Control-M, Tableau, Jira, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Visio
- **Additional Skills:** Adaptability, teamwork, effective time management, commitment to delivering high-quality results, and problem-solving.

## Education
- **Masters of Professional Studies in Data Science** from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with a CGPA of 4.0. Courses included Big Data Analytics, Data Management, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Project Management, and more.

- **Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering** from Raghu Engineering College, Visakhapatnam.
